# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard website that allows a user to search for a city name, and receive the cities current weather, as well as weather for the next 5 days. This includes an icon that displays weather conditions, as well as statistics for Temperature, Windspeed, and Humidity. It also allows you to click on previously entered cities to see their weather information. Powered mostly by the '5 day weather forecast' api from OpenWeather, as well as Javascript to assist with functionality and dynamically generate elements on the page, this website is a great tool for figuring out what's ahead. Although simple, the following image is what one may see upon first opening the page.

## Usage

After opening the website, the first step is to enter a city name, and press the "Get Weather" button. Once a city name has been successfully entered, you'll be able to see weather for today, and well as the 5 day weather forecast underneath. Furthermore if you'd like to see the weather for previously submitted cities, simply click on it's name in the history list to pull the information back up. The following image is what one may see after checking the weather in multiple cities.
